A Machine Learning Approach for Biomarker Discovery

We propose to develop a robust and reproducible methodology for biomarker discovery in microbiome data using machine learning. This methodology aims to address the challenges of reproducibility and consistency in biomedical research. We plan to apply this methodology to identify potential biomarkers for diseases such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). Our approach will utilize the DADA2 pipeline for 16s rRNA sequences processing and the Recursive Ensemble Feature Selection (REFS) algorithm for feature selection across multiple datasets. We believe this approach will enhance reproducibility and yield robust results.

These are the results of the different taxa, validated in different datasets.
